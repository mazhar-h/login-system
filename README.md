# LoginSystem
This project was aimed at building a Secure Login System with Angular and Spring Boot. The project allows a user to create an account while requiring a username, email address, and password. The project includes login with socials like Google and Facebook. When the user logs in, they are welcomed with a dashboard that grabs weather data based on your IP location. A regular user can update their email and password in the settings. An admin user is given additional abilities like creating a new user, updating a user, deleting a user, and retrieving a list of users on the system.

## Security
This project enables security with technologies like Spring Security, JWT authorization and authentication, and password hashing.
